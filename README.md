# Carsharing App

## Vision

### Stakeholders  
The main stakeholders in the carsharing app are lenders and borrowers.  

---

### Problems  

#### Lender  
A lender wants their car to be used rather than sitting idle. They are not earning money from it, and over time, the car loses its value.  

#### Borrower  
A borrower does not own a car but wants to drive. They only need a car occasionally, for example, for bigger shopping trips or outings. They do not want to deal with car maintenance, technical inspections, or mandatory insurance.

### Benefits  

#### Lender  
The lender does not have to worry about the trustworthiness of borrowers because the platform guarantees everything. Any fines incurred are transferred to the platform, which then charges them to the borrower. Additionally, the lender can set specific conditions for how the car can be used, such as limiting the driving distance, restricting foreign travel, or prohibiting highway or off-road driving.  

#### Borrower  
The borrower does not need to worry about the trustworthiness of the lender. They receive detailed information about the car's condition, whether it is old and cheap or new and expensive, allowing them to make an informed decision.
